Fundamentals is a plugin that provides its users with a variety of useful commands and features.

**Some of the features include:**
1. Emoji Chat
1. Players kits and first join kits.
1. Simple player-to-player teleport requests.
1. Private messaging.
1. Full Moderator support (Kicking, Banning, Jailing, Muting).
1. Shutdown timer.
1. Instant nametags.
1. Weather Control
1. Player mentions with chatting @PlayerName

**FAQ:**
* Why use this instead of Essentials? FundamentalsX is being updated frequently and already includes features that Essentials does not have. FundamentalsX will always be updated for new versions of Spigot Minecraft.
* What should I do if there is a feature I want? Go ahead and request the feature in the discussions. Chances are that I would be happy to add it. Please do not request features by leaving a negative review.
* Do you have a demonstration video? Not currently. If anyone makes one and shares with me, I'll gladly add the video to this page.

If you run into any trouble, please post in the [SpigotMC discussion thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fundamentalsx.30665/) or report an [issue](https://github.com/WiseHollow/FundamentalsX/issues) here. I am happy to update, and add features.
