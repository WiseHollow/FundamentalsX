# FAQ:
# Can we customize prefixes? Yes, prefixes can be changed to have words and colors. By default, they are only colors.
# What other languages are supported? Check the config.yml for a list of supported languages.
# Can I help with translations? Yes you definitely can. Translate from the English version into any official language and speak with me on SpigotMC about it.
